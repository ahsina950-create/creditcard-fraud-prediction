1- data exploration-dealing with class imbalance
visualizing clusters(fraus vs non fraud) using pca(or maybe TSNE)

2- normalize 'amount' and 'time'

3- logistics regression, random forest, XGBoost
isolationforest(anomaly detection )

4- no using accuracy, instead use precision, recall, ROC-AUC
RECALL- beacuse i dont want to miss any fraud cases
AUC score closer to 1 = almost no imbalance

5- using SHAP to see why a transaction was fraud
